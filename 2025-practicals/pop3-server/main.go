At its core, DDD is a way of designing software that keeps the business domain, not the database schema or the latest framework, at the center of decision-making. It insists that engineers collaborate deeply with domain experts during the project lifecycle, not just to gather requirements once and vanish into Jira tickets. It gives teams the vocabulary, patterns, and boundaries to model complex systems without getting buried in accidental complexity.\nDDD doesn‚Äôt care whether the architecture is monolithic or microservice-based. What it does care about is whether the model reflects the real-world rules and language of the domain, and whether that model can evolve safely as the domain changes.In this article, we explore the core ideas of DDD (such as Bounded Contexts, Aggregates, and Ubiquitous Language) and walk through how they work together in practice.¬† We will also look at how DDD fits into real-world systems, where it shines, and where it can fall flat.",
