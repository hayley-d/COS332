?What is the primary goal of the Paxos algorithm in distributed systems?
-To synchronize system clocks
-To optimize network throughput
+To achieve consensus in a distributed system
-To provide eventual consistency

?What problem does gRPC solve in distributed systems?
-Managing large datasets in memory
+Providing high-performance, language-agnostic remote procedure calls
-Coordinating consensus among nodes
-Synchronizing distributed clocks

?Which protocol does gRPC use for transport?
+HTTP/2
-HTTP/1.1
-UDP
-RPC over TCP

?In the context of distributed databases, what does CAP theorem state?
-A distributed system can achieve consistency, availability, and partition tolerance simultaneously
+A distributed system can achieve at most two of consistency, availability, and partition tolerance
-Consistency and availability are mutually exclusive
-Partition tolerance is optional

?Which consistency model allows reads to see the most recently written value?
-Eventual Consistency
-Causal Consistency
+Strong Consistency
-Session Consistency

?What is the primary role of a coordinator node in a two-phase commit protocol?
-To act as a backup node in case of failure
-To handle all write operations
+To manage the voting process and finalize the transaction
-To replicate data across all participants

?Which of the following protocols is used for distributed clock synchronization?
+NTP
-DNS
-Paxos
-Raft

?What is the main purpose of a quorum in distributed systems?
-To determine the order of events in a distributed ledger
-To guarantee fault tolerance in a single-node system
+To ensure consistency across replicas
-To limit the number of nodes involved in consensus

?In Paxos, what happens if two proposers propose values concurrently?
-One proposal is ignored, and the other is accepted
-The system enters a deadlock state
+The protocol ensures safety, but liveness may be temporarily compromised
-All acceptors reject both proposals

?What does the term "sharding" refer to in distributed databases?
-The process of compressing data to save space
+Partitioning data into smaller, manageable chunks
-The replication of data across multiple nodes
-Using hashing to store data on disk

?What is the primary difference between Paxos and Raft consensus algorithms?
-Paxos is used for leader election, while Raft is not
+Raft is designed to be simpler to understand and implement compared to Paxos
-Paxos guarantees better fault tolerance than Raft
-Raft does not require a quorum, but Paxos does

?In a distributed system, what does a Lamport Timestamp ensure?
+The ordering of events in a system
-The exact time of an event in real-world time
-Guaranteed message delivery
-Synchronization of all system clocks

?What does CRDT stand for?
-Consistent Replication of Distributed Transactions
+Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type
-Centralized Relational Database Technology
-Consensus-Ready Distributed Transactions

?Which property of CRDTs ensures they converge to the same state across replicas?
-Eventual consistency
+Strong convergence
-Timestamp-based ordering
-Leader election

?What is the main advantage of using a CRDT in a distributed system?
-To avoid the need for replication
+To enable conflict-free merging of replicas without coordination
-To ensure strict ordering of events
-To implement leader election algorithms

?How does Paxos ensure safety in the presence of failures?
+By requiring a quorum of acceptors for decisions
-By using optimistic locking for transactions
-By synchronizing clocks across nodes
-By replicating data to all nodes in the cluster

?What does the "proposer" do in the Paxos protocol?
-Replicates data across all nodes
+Proposes a value to be agreed upon by the acceptors
-Synchronizes clocks in the distributed system
-Ensures all learners receive the final decision

?What kind of messages does gRPC typically use to define its interface?
-SOAP XML schemas
+Protocol Buffers (protobuf)
-JSON schemas
-FlatBuffers

?Which of the following is a common application of gRPC in distributed systems?
+Microservices communication
-Log aggregation
-Distributed lock management
-Synchronizing replicas in a database

?Which of these is a major challenge when using Paxos in a practical system?
-The lack of fault tolerance
+The complexity of implementation and debugging
-The absence of consensus guarantees
-The need for synchronous communication between nodes
