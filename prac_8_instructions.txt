Your assignment
You are expected to set up the following software on your virtual server:
• The Apache server; and
• A suitable FTP dæmon (that is able to write to a directory served by Apache)
You are expected to write a program that monitors some HTML file on your
workstation. Whenever this file changes (such as when it is edited) your program
should notice the change and use the FTP protocol to send the updated version to
your server computer.
To demonstrate your program, point some browser to the appropriate URL on
your server computer, such that it will display the file in question. Then you edit
the HTML file on your workstation. Once you save it, it should automatically
be uploaded by the program you wrote. The browser (possibly after pressing
‘refresh’) will display the new version of the file.
As always, your program is not allowed to use any pre-existing FTP client
functionality: it has to open socket(s) and write FTP protocol commands and
other values to the socket(s) and read responses from the socket(s).
You may use polling to test whether the file in question has been updated on
the workstation. If you poll, say, once a minute and two updates within a minute
are not both uploaded, you will not be penalised.

Assessment
A working program will be awarded 8 out of 10. To earn a higher mark your
program has to do more than just the basics — in particular should it demonstrate
that you have some deeper knowledge of the FTP protocol.
